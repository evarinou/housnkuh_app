# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the housnkuh project.

## üîê Environment Variables & Secrets Management

### ‚úÖ Required Practices

1. **Never commit secrets to version control**
   - Use `.env` files for local development
   - Use secure secret management in production
   - All `.env*` files are in `.gitignore`

2. **Environment Variable Standards**
   ```bash
   # Use descriptive, consistent naming
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here
   DATABASE_URL=your-db-connection
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-pass
   
   # Include validation for required vars
   if (!process.env.JWT_SECRET) {
     throw new Error('JWT_SECRET is required');
   }
   ```

3. **Production Requirements**
   - JWT secrets must be 32+ characters
   - Database passwords must be strong
   - API keys must be rotated regularly
   - Use HTTPS for all external communications

### ‚ùå Security Violations Found & Fixed

| Issue | Status | Fix Applied |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Hardcoded `housnkuh_secret` | ‚úÖ Fixed | Environment variable with validation |
| Hardcoded admin setup key | ‚úÖ Fixed | Required environment variable |
| Private IP addresses in code | ‚úÖ Fixed | Environment variable alternatives |
| Hardcoded database URLs | ‚úÖ Fixed | Environment variable configuration |

## üõ°Ô∏è Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Best Practices
- Use strong secrets (32+ characters)
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Validate tokens on every request

### Password Security
- Hash passwords with bcrypt (min 10 rounds)
- Enforce strong password policies
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Use secure password reset flows

## üîí Data Protection

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Implement rate limiting

### Email Security
- Validate email formats
- Use secure SMTP configurations
- Implement email verification
- Prevent email enumeration attacks

## üöß Network Security

### HTTPS Configuration
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement HSTS headers
- Use secure cookie flags
- Configure proper CORS policies

### Database Security
- Use connection encryption
- Implement database user permissions
- Regular security updates
- Network-level access controls

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
- Log authentication attempts
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Track admin actions
- Alert on suspicious activity

### Error Handling
- Don't expose stack traces in production
- Log errors securely
- Implement proper error responses
- Monitor error patterns

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
npm audit

# Secret scanning (use tools like)
git-secrets --scan

# Code quality checks
eslint --ext .ts,.js src/
```

### Manual Reviews
- Code review for security issues
- Regular penetration testing
- Third-party security audits
- Documentation reviews

## üö® Incident Response

### Response Plan
1. **Identify**: Detect and analyze security incident
2. **Contain**: Limit damage and prevent spread
3. **Eradicate**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
4. **Recover**: Restore systems and services
5. **Learn**: Document and improve processes
