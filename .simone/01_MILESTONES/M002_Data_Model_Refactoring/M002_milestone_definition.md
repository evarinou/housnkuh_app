# Milestone M002: Data Model Refactoring - Separation of Concerns

## Executive Summary
Refactor the monolithic User model into three distinct models (User, Vendor, NewsletterSubscriber) to improve maintainability, performance, and adherence to SOLID principles. This refactoring addresses critical technical debt identified in the project review.

## Problem Statement
The current User model violates the Single Responsibility Principle by combining:
- Basic user authentication (username, password, admin status)
- Newsletter subscription management (confirmation, tokens, preferences)
- Vendor-specific data (profile, trial periods, booking status)

This creates:
- Unnecessary complexity in data queries
- Risk of unintended side effects when modifying features
- Performance overhead from loading unused fields
- Difficulty in reasoning about data flow

## Success Criteria
1. [ ] Three separate, focused models: User, Vendor, NewsletterSubscriber
2. [ ] Zero functionality regression - all existing features continue working
3. [ ] Improved query performance (measured via response times)
4. [ ] Clean migration path with data integrity maintained
5. [ ] Updated API endpoints with backward compatibility
6. [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for new models

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Model Design & Planning
- Design new model schemas with clear relationships
- Plan migration strategy with rollback capability
- Identify all affected code paths
- Create compatibility layer design

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Create New Models**
   - User: Core authentication and admin status
   - Vendor: All vendor-specific data with userId reference
   - NewsletterSubscriber: Newsletter-specific data

2. **Implement Compatibility Layer**
   - Virtual properties on User model for backward compatibility
   - Facade pattern for gradual migration
   - Deprecation warnings for old accessors

3. **Migrate Endpoints**
   - Update controllers to use appropriate models
   - Maintain backward compatibility with response shaping
   - Add new optimized endpoints

4. **Data Migration**
   - Script to split existing User documents
   - Validation of migrated data
   - Performance testing of new structure

### Phase 3: Cleanup
- Remove compatibility layers after full migration
- Update all documentation
- Performance optimization based on new structure

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Data loss during migration
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup strategy, staged rollout
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Compatibility layer, extensive testing
- **Risk**: Performance degradation
  - **Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after, query optimization

## Dependencies
- Completion of current Trial System implementation (M001)
- Full test coverage of existing functionality
- Database backup and rollback procedures

## Deliverables
1. New model schemas and TypeScript interfaces
2. Migration scripts with rollback capability
3. Updated API documentation
4. Performance comparison report
5. Updated test suite
