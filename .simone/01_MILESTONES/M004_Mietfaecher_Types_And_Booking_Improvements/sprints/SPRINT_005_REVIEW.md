## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Complete Removal of Fixed Mietfach Prices
**Decision**: Eliminate `preis` field from Mietfach data structure entirely
**Rationale**: Individual pricing per assignment provides maximum flexibility
**Impact**: Simplified codebase, eliminated price synchronization issues

### 2. Manual Price Setting for All Assignments
**Decision**: Require admin to set price for every selected Mietfach
**Rationale**: Ensures conscious pricing decisions and prevents accidental charges
**Impact**: More deliberate pricing, better cost control

### 3. Frontend-Backend Data Format Standardization
**Decision**: Send simple number values for price adjustments
**Rationale**: Match backend validation expectations and reduce complexity
**Impact**: Eliminated data format conflicts, improved reliability

### 4. Prominent Comments Display Strategy
**Decision**: Show comments at top of assignment modal in warning-style box
**Rationale**: Critical information needs immediate admin attention
**Impact**: Better decision-making, reduced assignment errors

### 5. Comprehensive Input Validation
**Decision**: Validate price inputs on frontend before submission
**Rationale**: Immediate feedback prevents backend errors and improves UX
**Impact**: Reduced error rates, better user experience

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Admin Workflow Integration
- **Natural Comment Flow**: Comments visible in both list and assignment views
- **Intuitive Price Setting**: Clear labels and immediate validation feedback
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information (comments) prominently displayed
- **Efficient Operations**: Price setting integrated seamlessly into assignment flow

### Accessibility and Usability
- **Clear Error Messages**: German error text matches application language
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order maintained for price input fields
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time validation with color-coded messages
- **Consistent Design**: Price inputs match existing form styling

## Error Resolution

### Critical Fix: Booking Confirmation with Price Adjustments
**Problem**: "Fehler beim Bestätigen der Buchung" when setting custom prices
**Root Cause**: Multiple data format and validation conflicts
**Solution**: Comprehensive frontend fixes for undefined price handling
**Impact**: All Mietfach types now assignable with custom pricing

### Data Format Mismatch Resolution
**Problem**: Frontend sending nested objects, backend expecting simple numbers
**Root Cause**: Interface evolution without coordination
**Solution**: Standardized on simple number format for price adjustments
**Impact**: Eliminated validation errors, improved API reliability

### Undefined Price Handling
**Problem**: "Sonstige Fläche" and other units without predefined prices caused errors
**Root Cause**: Code assumed all Mietfächer had price field
**Solution**: Robust undefined/null handling throughout price logic
**Impact**: All Mietfach types now supported regardless of preset pricing

## Integration Points

### Backend Integration
- ✅ Price adjustments properly formatted for existing API
- ✅ Comments data included in assignment process
- ✅ Validation compatibility maintained
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing endpoints

### Admin Interface Components
- ✅ PendingBookingsPage fully updated with comments display
