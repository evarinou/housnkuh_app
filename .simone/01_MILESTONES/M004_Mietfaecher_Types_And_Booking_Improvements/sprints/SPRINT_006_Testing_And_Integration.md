# Sprint M004_S006: Testing and Integration

## Sprint Goal
Comprehensive testing of all new features, integration validation, and preparation for deployment.

## Sprint Backlog

### Comprehensive Testing
1. **Backend API Testing**
   - Test all new Mietfächer types in booking flow
   - Validate comments storage and retrieval
   - Test price adjustment API endpoints
   - Verify data integrity with new fields
   - Load testing with extended data structures

2. **Frontend Component Testing**
   - PackageBuilder with all new options
   - Comments field validation and submission
   - Admin interface price adjustment functionality
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing
   - Mobile responsiveness verification

3. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end booking flow with comments
   - Admin assignment with price adjustments
   - Contract creation with adjusted pricing
   - Email notifications with new information
   - Database migration validation

### Test Scenarios
1. **Booking Flow Tests**
   ```
   Scenario: Vendor books new Mietfächer types with comments
   Given: PackageBuilder includes all 7 types
   When: Vendor selects gefrierregal and adds comments
   Then: Booking created with correct type and comments stored
   ```

2. **Admin Assignment Tests**
   ```
   Scenario: Admin adjusts pricing during assignment
   Given: Pending booking with vendor comments
   When: Admin assigns Mietfach and adjusts price
   Then: Contract created with adjusted pricing and discounts applied
   ```

3. **Data Migration Tests**
   ```
   Scenario: Existing bookings remain functional
   Given: Database with existing Mietfächer and bookings
   When: Migration script runs
   Then: All existing data preserved and new types available
   ```

### Regression Testing
1. **Existing Functionality**
   - Verify all current booking flows still work
   - Test existing Mietfächer types unchanged
   - Validate existing admin assignment process
   - Check contract creation for existing bookings

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Database query performance with new fields
   - Frontend rendering with additional options
   - API response times with extended data
   - Memory usage validation

### Quality Assurance
1. **Code Quality**
   - TypeScript compilation without errors
   - ESLint compliance
   - Test coverage metrics
   - Code review completion

2. **User Experience**
   - UI/UX validation for new features
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Error message clarity
   - Loading state appropriateness

### Documentation Updates
1. **Technical Documentation**
   - API documentation for new endpoints
   - Database schema documentation
   - Component documentation updates
   - Migration guide documentation

2. **User Documentation**
   - Admin guide for price adjustments
   - Vendor guide for booking comments
   - FAQ updates for new Mietfächer types
