# Sprint: Critical Infrastructure Fix Sprint - Test Infrastructure & Project Management (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Fix critical blocking infrastructure issues preventing reliable development workflow, including Jest configuration, API test coverage, project status accuracy, and sprint planning structure.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- âœ… Fix Jest configuration to handle ES module imports (axios)
- âœ… Create basic API tests for critical endpoints
- âœ… Synchronize project status documentation with actual implementation
- âœ… Establish formal sprint planning structure
- ðŸ”„ Clean up file organization (assets, debug files)
- ðŸ”„ Stabilize development workflow (lint/test commands in CLAUDE.md)
- ðŸ”„ Final documentation sync

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- All tests run successfully without configuration errors
- Critical API endpoints have basic test coverage
- Project documentation accurately reflects implementation status
- Sprint planning structure is established and documented
- Development workflow is stable and documented
- No blocking infrastructure issues remain

## Progress Tracking
- **R001**: âœ… Jest configuration fixed - ES modules now work
- **R002**: âœ… API tests created - 5 tests covering critical endpoints (store opening, newsletter, contact)
- **R003**: âœ… Project status synchronized - M001 status corrected, implementation tracking JSON created
- **R004**: âœ… Sprint planning structure established - Guide created, current sprint documented
- **R005**: âœ… File organization cleanup - Assets moved to proper locations, debug files cleaned
- **R006**: âœ… Development workflow stabilized - Commands documented in CLAUDE.md
- **R007**: âœ… Documentation fully synchronized - All discrepancies resolved

## Success Metrics Achieved
- Jest test suite: âœ… 5/5 tests passing
- API coverage: âœ… Core endpoints tested (store opening, newsletter, contact)
- Documentation accuracy: âœ… Implementation status tracking established
- Sprint structure: âœ… Formal planning process in place

## Notes
- Jest configuration required transformIgnorePatterns for axios ES modules
- IntersectionObserver mock needed for react-intersection-observer
- Project status was more accurate than initially thought - most M001 work is indeed pending
- Sprint planning structure follows Simone framework conventions
