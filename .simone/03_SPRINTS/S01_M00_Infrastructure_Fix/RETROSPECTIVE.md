# Sprint S01 Retrospective - M000 Infrastructure Fix

## Sprint Summary
- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Goal**: Fix critical blocking infrastructure issues
- **Outcome**: âœ… All 7 requirements completed successfully

## What Went Well âœ…
- **Jest Configuration**: Problem identification and fix were straightforward
- **API Testing**: Supertest integration worked smoothly with in-memory MongoDB
- **File Organization**: Asset restructuring improved project cleanliness
- **Documentation**: Status synchronization revealed accurate current state
- **Sprint Planning**: Framework establishment provides clear structure going forward

## What Could Be Improved ðŸ”„
- **Initial Problem Assessment**: Could have identified all related issues upfront
- **Test Verbosity**: Email sending tests are very verbose - consider mocking in future
- **Asset Import Updates**: Multiple files needed manual updates after moving assets

## Lessons Learned ðŸ“š
- **Infrastructure First**: Critical infrastructure issues must be resolved before feature work
- **Status Accuracy**: Regular status synchronization prevents documentation drift
- **Test Foundation**: Solid test infrastructure enables confident development
- **Sprint Structure**: Clear requirements and tracking improve delivery predictability

## Action Items for Future Sprints
1. **Mock External Services**: Mock email service in tests to reduce noise
2. **Automated Asset Management**: Consider automated import path updates
3. **Regular Status Checks**: Schedule periodic documentation synchronization
4. **Incremental Infrastructure**: Address infrastructure issues as they arise

## Metrics
- **Requirements Completed**: 7/7 (100%)
- **Tests Added**: 6 total (1 client, 5 server)
- **Files Organized**: ~15 assets moved to proper structure
- **Documentation Updated**: 4 major files synchronized

## Next Sprint Preparation
- **M000 Unblocks M001**: Can now proceed with vendor registration features
- **Sprint Framework**: Structure established for S02 planning
- **Technical Foundation**: Stable base for feature development
