# Sprint: Core Trial System Implementation (S04)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the foundational trial period activation logic and automated status tracking system for the vendor registration trial system.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **R003: Trial Period Activation** - Automatic trial creation when store opens
- **R008: Trial Status Tracking** - Automated status transitions (preregistered → trial_active → trial_expired)
- Scheduled job infrastructure for automated trial processes
- Email notification system for trial status changes
- Comprehensive test coverage for trial system logic

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Vendors automatically receive 30-day trials when store opening date is reached
- Trial status transitions work correctly with proper validation and error handling
- Email notifications are sent for trial start and end events
- Scheduled jobs can handle bulk trial activation for multiple vendors
- Test coverage >90% for all trial system components
- Trial activation logic handles edge cases (date changes, bulk processing)

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint establishes the core business logic for the entire trial system
- Focus on reliability and data integrity for trial activation processes
- Ensure proper error handling for edge cases (timezone issues, bulk operations)
- Consider performance implications for large numbers of simultaneous activations
