- [x] Navigation remains responsive across devices
- [x] Fallback behavior works for missing images

### Sprint S09B Success Criteria:

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks:
- **Image Loading Performance**: Profile images might slow down navigation
  - *Mitigation*: Implement lazy loading and optimized image sizes

- **Authentication State Sync**: Booking flow might have race conditions
  - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing of authentication state changes

### Medium Priority Risks:
- **Dashboard Layout Complexity**: Adding 4 new cards might crowd the interface
  - *Mitigation*: Responsive grid design and careful spacing

- **Mobile Navigation**: Profile image might affect mobile navigation
  - *Mitigation*: Responsive design testing and mobile-first approach
