# Task: Launch Day Monitoring and Alerting System

## Description
Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting infrastructure for launch day operations to ensure system reliability and rapid incident response. This includes health checks, performance monitoring, error tracking, and automated alerting for critical issues that could affect the user experience during the high-traffic launch period.

Based on research of the existing codebase, the application currently has:
- Basic console logging with structured messages (✅, ❌, ℹ️ emojis)
- Morgan HTTP logging middleware for request tracking
- Error handling patterns in controllers with try/catch blocks
- Scheduled jobs system with status monitoring (ScheduledJobs service)
- Email service with debug logging and connection monitoring
- Trial system with automated status tracking and statistics

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust monitoring foundation that enables:
- Real-time visibility into system health and performance
- Proactive alerting for critical issues before they impact users
- Comprehensive logging for debugging launch day issues
- Dashboard metrics for monitoring key business KPIs
- Automated notification system for the development team

Key objectives:
- Implement health check endpoints for system components
- Create monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics
- Set up automated alerting for critical system events
- Establish logging standards and centralized log management
- Build performance monitoring for database and API response times

## Technical Guidance

### Current State Analysis
The codebase already includes several monitoring-ready patterns:
- **Logging**: Structured console logging with emojis for visual parsing
- **Error Handling**: Consistent try/catch patterns across controllers
- **Health Indicators**: Database connection status, scheduled job status
- **Email Monitoring**: Connection tests and debug logging in emailService
- **Trial Metrics**: Statistics tracking in TrialService and ScheduledJobs

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Health Check System**
   - Build on existing MongoDB connection monitoring
   - Extend scheduled jobs status checking
   - Add email service health verification
   - Create comprehensive `/health` endpoint

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - Leverage existing trial statistics from TrialService
   - Extend with API response times and error rates
   - Monitor email delivery success rates
   - Track user registration and conversion metrics

3. **Alerting Infrastructure**
   - Use existing email service for alert delivery
   - Build on current error logging patterns
   - Create tiered alerting (warning, critical, emergency)
   - Integrate with admin notification system

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Extend Morgan logging with response time tracking
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Track scheduled job execution times
   - API endpoint performance metrics

### Technology Stack Recommendations
- **Monitoring Library**: Use lightweight monitoring middleware that integrates with Express
- **Metrics Storage**: In-memory metrics with optional Redis for persistence
- **Alerting**: Extend existing emailService for notifications
- **Dashboard**: Simple admin dashboard endpoint serving metrics JSON
- **Log Management**: Structured logging with log levels and rotation

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Core Health Checks
- Create health check service extending existing status patterns
- Implement `/api/health` endpoint with component status
- Add database connection, email service, and scheduled jobs monitoring
- Create admin endpoint for manual health check triggers

### Phase 2: Metrics and Alerting
- Implement metrics collection middleware for API requests
- Extend existing error handling with alert triggers
- Create alert configuration system (thresholds, recipients)
- Build notification service using existing emailService

### Phase 3: Dashboard and Reporting
- Create admin dashboard endpoint for real-time metrics
- Implement trial system KPI tracking (registrations, activations, conversions)
- Add system performance metrics (response times, error rates)
- Create daily/hourly summary reports

### Critical Alert Categories
1. **System Health**: Database disconnection, service unavailability
2. **Email Service**: SMTP failures, delivery issues during registration
3. **Trial System**: Failed activations, expired trial notifications
4. **Performance**: High response times, error rate spikes
5. **Business KPIs**: Zero registrations, failed contest submissions

### Integration Points
- Extend existing ScheduledJobs service for monitoring tasks
- Use current Settings model for alert configuration
- Leverage VendorAuthController patterns for admin endpoints
- Build on trialService statistics for business metrics
