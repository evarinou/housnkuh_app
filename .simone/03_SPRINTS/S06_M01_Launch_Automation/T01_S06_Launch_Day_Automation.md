# T01_S06_Launch_Day_Automation.md

## Task Overview
**ID:** T01_S06  
**Sprint:** S06 - M01 Launch Automation  
**Priority:** High  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 5  

## Description

⚠️ **UPDATED REQUIREMENT** - NO COMING SOON / PRE-LAUNCH FUNCTIONALITY

~~Implement R009 requirement - Launch Day Automation system that automatically activates vendor trial periods when the configured store opening date arrives. This feature ensures seamless mass activation of pre-registered vendors without manual intervention.~~

**NEW IMPLEMENTATION**: Since there is NO Coming Soon page and NO pre-launch mode, this task focuses on:
1. **Immediate trial activation** for vendor registrations
2. **Admin monitoring tools** for vendor trial management  
3. **Automated trial status management** for active vendors
4. **NO store opening date logic** - application is always "open"

The system monitors vendor trial periods and provides admin tools for trial management without any store opening restrictions.

## Research Notes

### Existing Codebase Analysis

#### Store Settings Model (`/server/src/models/Settings.ts`)
- **Opening Date Configuration**: `storeOpening.openingDate` stores the launch date
- **Status Checking**: `isStoreOpen()` method validates if current date >= opening date
- **Enable/Disable**: `storeOpening.enabled` controls if opening date logic is active
- **Modification Tracking**: `lastModified` and `modifiedBy` for audit trail

#### Trial Activation Logic (`/server/src/services/trialService.ts`)
- **Mass Activation**: `activateTrialsOnStoreOpening()` method already exists
- **Single Vendor**: `activateSingleVendorTrial()` handles individual activation
- **Status Updates**: Changes `registrationStatus` from 'preregistered' to 'trial_active'
- **Email Integration**: Sends activation emails via `sendTrialActivationEmail()`
- **Error Handling**: Returns `TrialActivationResult` with success/failure counts

#### Scheduled Job System (`/server/src/services/scheduledJobs.ts`)
- **Cron Integration**: Uses `node-cron` for scheduling
- **Hourly Check**: `scheduleTrialActivationCheck()` runs every hour
- **Manual Triggers**: Admin endpoints for manual activation
- **Status Monitoring**: Job status and statistics tracking
- **Timezone**: Configured for 'Europe/Berlin'

#### Email Service Integration (`/server/src/utils/emailService.ts`)
- **Trial Activation**: `sendTrialActivationEmail()` for successful activations
- **Error Handling**: Email failures don't block trial activation process

## Technical Guidance

### Key Files to Focus On:
1. **`/server/src/services/scheduledJobs.ts`** - Already contains trial activation check logic
2. **`/server/src/services/trialService.ts`** - Contains `checkForTrialActivation()` method
3. **`/server/src/models/Settings.ts`** - Store opening date configuration
4. **`/server/src/controllers/adminController.ts`** - Admin endpoints for manual control

### Existing Infrastructure:
- ✅ Store opening date configuration in Settings model
- ✅ Trial activation logic in TrialService
- ✅ Scheduled job system with hourly checks
- ✅ Email notification system
- ✅ Admin endpoints for manual triggers

### Current Implementation Status:
The core launch day automation is **already implemented** in the existing codebase:
- `ScheduledJobs.scheduleTrialActivationCheck()` runs every hour
- `TrialService.checkForTrialActivation()` checks store opening status
- `TrialService.activateTrialsOnStoreOpening()` handles mass activation

## Implementation Notes

### Current System Flow:
1. **Hourly Check**: Scheduled job runs `checkForTrialActivation()` every hour
2. **Store Status**: Checks `settings.isStoreOpen()` for opening date validation
3. **Vendor Query**: Finds all vendors with `registrationStatus: 'preregistered'`
4. **Mass Activation**: Calls `activateTrialsOnStoreOpening()` if conditions met
5. **Individual Processing**: Each vendor processed via `activateSingleVendorTrial()`
6. **Status Update**: Changes status to 'trial_active' and sets trial dates
7. **Email Notification**: Sends activation email to each vendor
8. **Error Handling**: Logs failures but continues processing other vendors

### Required Enhancements:

#### 1. Improve Launch Day Precision
- **Current**: Hourly checks may cause up to 59-minute delay
- **Enhancement**: Add precise launch time check (not just date)
- **Implementation**: Modify `isStoreOpen()` to include time component

#### 2. Enhanced Monitoring & Logging
- **Current**: Basic console logging
- **Enhancement**: Structured logging with launch day specific markers
- **Implementation**: Add dedicated launch day log entries and metrics

#### 3. Admin Notification System
- **Current**: No admin notification of mass activation
- **Enhancement**: Send summary email to admins after launch day activation
- **Implementation**: Add admin notification to activation result processing

#### 4. Launch Day Dashboard
- **Current**: Basic trial statistics endpoint
- **Enhancement**: Real-time launch day monitoring dashboard
- **Implementation**: Add launch day specific metrics and status endpoints

#### 5. Rollback & Recovery
- **Current**: No rollback mechanism for failed activations
- **Enhancement**: Ability to retry failed activations and rollback if needed
- **Implementation**: Add retry logic and rollback endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Requirements (R009):
- [ ] **AC1**: System automatically detects when store opening date is reached
- [ ] **AC2**: All pre-registered vendors are activated simultaneously on opening date
- [ ] **AC3**: Trial periods start exactly on the configured opening date
- [ ] **AC4**: Activation emails are sent to all successfully activated vendors
- [ ] **AC5**: Failed activations are logged and can be retried manually
- [ ] **AC6**: Admin receives summary notification of launch day activation results

### Technical Requirements:
- [ ] **AC7**: Launch day activation works within ±5 minutes of configured opening time
- [ ] **AC8**: System handles partial failures gracefully (some vendors succeed, others fail)
- [ ] **AC9**: All activation attempts are logged with detailed success/failure information
- [ ] **AC10**: Admin dashboard shows real-time launch day activation status
- [ ] **AC11**: Manual retry mechanism available for failed activations

### Performance & Reliability:
- [ ] **AC12**: System can handle activation of 1000+ vendors within 10 minutes
- [ ] **AC13**: Email sending failures don't block trial activation process
- [ ] **AC14**: Database operations are atomic and recoverable
- [ ] **AC15**: System continues normal operation after launch day activation

- **AdminController**: Manual trigger endpoints

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Core functionality already implemented and tested
- **Medium Risk**: Email system reliability during mass activation
- **Low Risk**: Database performance with large vendor batches
- **Low Risk**: Timezone and date calculation accuracy

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing (TrialService, Settings)
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end launch day simulation
3. **Load Tests**: Mass activation with 500+ test vendors

- Existing scheduled job runs every hour and handles launch day detection
- Current system is production-ready but could benefit from precision and monitoring improvements
