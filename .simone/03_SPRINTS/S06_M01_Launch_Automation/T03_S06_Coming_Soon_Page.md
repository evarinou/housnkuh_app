## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT PROJECT DECISION

**This task has been CANCELLED permanently. The project does NOT require a Coming Soon page.**

### Decision Summary
- **Date**: 2025-06-10
- **Decision**: Remove all Coming Soon functionality 
- **Rationale**: Full application functionality should be immediately available
- **Implementation**: Coming Soon page and related logic completely removed from codebase

### What Was Removed
- ComingSoonPage.tsx component
- ConditionalApp.tsx conditional rendering logic
- StoreSettingsContext.tsx store opening logic
- All store opening/coming soon related conditional rendering

### Current Implementation
- Application loads directly to full functionality
- No pre-launch restrictions or coming soon state
- Vendor registration works immediately with trial period starting instantly
- All features accessible from launch

## ~~Description~~ **CANCELLED**

~~Implement a professional coming soon page for the pre-launch period (R010). This page will be conditionally displayed based on store opening status and provide visitors with essential information about the upcoming housnkuh marketplace while collecting email signups for launch notifications.~~

**üö´ NO COMING SOON PAGE - This requirement has been permanently cancelled.**

## Project Requirements Update

### For All Future Development:
- **NEVER implement Coming Soon pages**
- **NO conditional rendering based on "store opening" status** 
- **NO pre-launch modes or restrictions**
- **Full application functionality must be immediately available**
- **Vendor registration should work immediately**

### Developer Guidelines:
1. If any requirements mention "Coming Soon" or "pre-launch" - **IGNORE THEM**
2. Implement full functionality immediately 
3. No store opening configuration needed
4. No conditional application states

## Status: CANCELLED

This task will never be implemented. The application design is for immediate full functionality.
