## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Components Structure
```
components/vendor/products/
├── ProductList.tsx
├── ProductForm.tsx
├── ProductCard.tsx
├── ProductFilters.tsx
├── CategorySelector.tsx
├── ImageUploader.tsx
└── BulkActions.tsx
```

### Backend Structure
```
server/src/
├── models/Product.ts

├── routes/productRoutes.ts
└── middleware/productValidation.ts
```

### Database Indexes
- Vendor ID + Created Date (compound)

3. **Performance with Large Catalogs**: Implement proper pagination and caching
4. **Data Loss**: Implement soft deletes and change history

## Timeline Estimate
- Setup and Data Model: 2 days
- CRUD Interface: 3 days
- Image Management: 2 days
- Search and Filtering: 1 day
- Testing and Polish: 2 days
- **Total**: 10 days

## Notes
- Consider future POS integration requirements
- Maintain consistency with existing UI patterns
- Document API for external system integration
